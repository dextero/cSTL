Pseudo-templates for C

*WARNING*: I wrote this code a long time ago, when I had little experience in programming. It uses lots of ugly hacks that may or may not work in your environment. Use at your own risk!

If you want to use somthing well-tested, take a look at the awesome generic linked-list implementation from https://github.com/AVSystem/avs_commons
